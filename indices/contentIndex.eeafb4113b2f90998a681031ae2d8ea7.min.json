As cities face climate change impacts, economic uncertainty and other socio-political crisis, governments and urban designers post covid are ever looking to make the link between resilience theory and practice (Feliciotti 2018; Forgaci 2020; Yip et al. 2021). The Singaporean government is especially interested in building resiliency. In their 2020 report, they discussed key targets and tangible solutions they are implementing as they call resiliency the next chapter (Urban Redevelopment Authority 2021).

I am constantly seeking ways to empower end users, promote their health and well-being, and create spaces that truly work for them.\n\nI believe that by taking a human-centered approach and involving users in the design process, we can create spaces that better meet end user needs and promote better well-being. \n\nI am particularly interested in co-design, which involves collaborating with users and other stakeholders to co-create solutions. By involving users in the design process, we can gain a better understanding of their needs and preferences, and create spaces that truly work for them. In addition to co-design, I am also interested in data-led research. By collecting and analyzing data on user behavior and preferences, we can gain insights into how spaces are actually used and identify areas for improvement. This data can also help us measure the impact of design interventions and make more informed decisions about future projects. Finally, I am passionate about finding new ways to communicate and convey design ideas. I believe that by using innovative tools and techniques, we can make design concepts more accessible and engaging for a wider range of people. Whether it's through virtual reality, interactive models, or other mediums, I am always looking for new ways to bring design ideas to life\"\n","lastmodified":"2023-05-01T06:33:10.974146824Z","tags":null}}
